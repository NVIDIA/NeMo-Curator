        Initialize the Resiliparse text extraction algorithm with specified parameters.

        The Resiliparse algorithm extracts structural or semantic information from noisy raw web data for further processing,
        such as (main) content extraction / boilerplate removal, schema extraction, general web data cleansing, and more.

        It is implemented via the `extract_plain_text` function in the `resiliparse.extract.html2text` module.
        Resiliparse HTML2Text is a very fast and rule-based plain text extractor for HTML pages which uses the Resiliparse DOM parser.
        The `extract_plain_text` function extracts all visible text nodes inside the HTML document's <body>.
        Only <script>, <style> and a few other (generally) invisible elements are skipped and very basic ASCII formatting is applied.

        Please refer to the Resiliparse documentation for more details: https://resiliparse.chatnoir.eu/en/latest/man/extract/html2text.html

        NeMo Curator has added a stopword density filter to the Resiliparse extraction process, which requires that a paragraph contains a certain proportion of stopwords.

        Args:
            required_stopword_density: Proportion of stopwords required preserve an extracted paragraph.
                Studies on stopword lists and their distribution in various text corpora often
                suggest that around 30-40% of a typical English text consists of stopwords.
            main_content: Whether to apply simple heuristics for extracting only "main-content" elements.
            alt_texts: Whether to preserve alternative text descriptions (e.g., for images).
