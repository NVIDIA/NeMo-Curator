## Fuzzy Deduplication Steps
This directory consists of scripts that can be invoked directly via the command line for finding fuzzy duplicates from a group of Jsonl files consisting of text & unique ID's that are specifically formatted using the `add_id` script included as a part of NeMo-Curator.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> The up to date documentation on running the fuzzy deduplication scripts can be found in the [NeMo Curator User Guide](https://docs.nvidia.com/nemo-framework/user-guide/latest/datacuration/gpudeduplication.html#id4). It is recommended to use the Python API directly rather than the CLI scripts for most cases.
