  # The filters below define a chain of heuristic filters to be applied to each document in a corpus.
  # This particular cascade of filters is intended to filter Python code data.
  # The filter listed at the top will be applied first, and the following filters will be applied in
  # the order they appear in this file. Each filter can be removed and re-ordered as desired.
  # Change this based on the language of the data
  # Code filter implementations are in nemo_curator/filter/code.py
