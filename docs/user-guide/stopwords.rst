Stop Words in Text Processing
=============================

Stop words are common words that are filtered out in natural language processing (NLP) tasks because they don't carry significant meaning. These words appear so frequently in language that they can distort text processing tasks. Examples in English include "the," "is," "at," "which," and "on."

.. note::
   Studies on stopword lists and their distribution in various text corpora have shown that typical English text contains 30–40% stop words.


NVIDIA NeMo Curator provides built-in stop word lists for several languages to support text analysis and extraction processes. You can use these lists for:

* **Text Extraction and Boilerplate Removal**: The text extraction process (especially for Common Crawl data) uses stop word density as a key metric to identify meaningful content and differentiate between main content and boilerplate in web pages
* **Language Detection**: Stop words help in language detection and processing
* **Efficient Processing**: Filtering stop words reduces the amount of data that needs to be processed

How it Works
-----------------------------------------

JusText Extractor
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The JusText algorithm uses stop word density to classify text blocks as main content or boilerplate:

1. **Context-Free Classification**: Text blocks with a high density of stop words are classified as "good" (likely main content)
2. **Parameter Customization**: You can customize the stop word density thresholds via ``stopwords_low`` and ``stopwords_high`` parameters

.. code-block:: python

   from nemo_curator.download import JusTextExtractor
   
   # Customize stop word thresholds
   extractor = JusTextExtractor(
       stopwords_low=0.30,   # Minimum stop word density
       stopwords_high=0.32,  # Maximum stop word density
   )

Resiliparse and Trafilatura Extractors
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

These extractors also use stop word density to filter extracted content:

.. code-block:: python

   from nemo_curator.download import ResiliparseExtractor, TrafilaturaExtractor
   
   # Resiliparse with custom stop word density
   resiliparse = ResiliparseExtractor(
       required_stopword_density=0.32  # Only keep paragraphs with >= 32% stop words
   )
   
   # Trafilatura with custom stop word density
   trafilatura = TrafilaturaExtractor(
       required_stopword_density=0.35  # Higher threshold for more selective extraction
   )

Available Stop Word Lists
------------------------

NeMo Curator leverages the extensive stop word collection from `JusText <https://github.com/miso-belica/jusText/tree/main/justext/stoplists>`_. In addition, NeMo Curator provides custom stop word lists for the following languages not covered by JusText:

.. list-table::
   :header-rows: 1
   :widths: 20 50 30

   * - Language
     - File Name
     - Number of Stop Words
   * - Chinese
     - ``zh_stopwords.py``
     - ~800
   * - Japanese
     - ``ja_stopwords.py``
     - ~140
   * - Thai
     - ``th_stopwords.py``
     - ~120
These stop word lists are implemented as Python frozen sets for efficient lookup and immutability.

Chinese Stop Words
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Chinese stop words in ``zh_stopwords.py`` form the largest list with around 800 entries, including words like "一个" (one), "不是" (isn't), and "他们" (they).

.. code-block:: python

   # Example from zh_stopwords.py (partial)
   zh_stopwords = frozenset([
       "、", "。", "〈", "〉", "《", "》", "一", "一个",
       # ... many more words
   ])

Japanese Stop Words
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Japanese stop words in ``ja_stopwords.py`` include approximately 140 common Japanese words like "あそこ" (there), "これ" (this), and "ます" (a polite verb ending).

.. code-block:: python

   # Example from ja_stopwords.py
   ja_stopwords = frozenset([
       "あそこ", "あっ", "あの", "あのかた", "あの人",
       # ... more words
       "私", "私達", "貴方", "貴方方",
   ])


Thai Stop Words
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Thai stop words are available in ``th_stopwords.py``. The file contains around 120 common Thai words like "กล่าว" (to say), "การ" (the), and "ของ" (of).

.. code-block:: python

   # Example from th_stopwords.py
   thai_stopwords = frozenset([
       "กล่าว", "กว่า", "กัน", "กับ", "การ", "ก็", "ก่อน",
       # ... more words
       "ไป", "ไม่", "ไว้",
   ])



Special Handling for Non-Spaced Languages
----------------------------------------

Languages like Thai, Chinese, Japanese, and Korean don't use spaces between words, which affects how stop word density is calculated. NeMo Curator identifies these languages via the ``NON_SPACED_LANGUAGES`` constant:

.. code-block:: python

   NON_SPACED_LANGUAGES = ["THAI", "CHINESE", "JAPANESE", "KOREAN"]

For these languages, special handling is applied:

* Stop word density calculations are disabled
* Boilerplate removal based on stop words is adjusted

Creating Custom Stop Word Lists
------------------------------

You can create and use your own stop word lists when processing text with NeMo Curator:

.. code-block:: python

   from nemo_curator.download import download_common_crawl
   
   # Define custom stop words for multiple languages
   custom_stop_lists = {
       "ENGLISH": frozenset(["the", "and", "is", "in", "for", "where", "when", "to", "at"]),
       "SPANISH": frozenset(["el", "la", "los", "las", "un", "una", "y", "o", "de", "en", "que"]),
   }
   
   # Use custom stop lists in download process
   dataset = download_common_crawl(
       "/output/folder",
       "2023-06",
       "2023-10",
       stop_lists=custom_stop_lists
   )

Performance Considerations
-------------------------

* Stop word lists are implemented as frozen sets for fast lookups (O(1) complexity)
* Using appropriate stop word lists can significantly improve extraction quality
* For specialized domains, consider customizing the stop word lists
